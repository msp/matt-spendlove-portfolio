# In Parallax

.copy-center[
What is a cinema without images? What are the sensorial conditions of vision? _In Parallax_ expands the traditional architectural space of film by doubling the in-real-life (IRL) gallery screen via a complementary virtual reality (VR) experience. The resulting parallax centralises the viewer in the space between IRL and VR, suspending them amidst two possible viewings of an interconnected but differently realised work.

# In Parallax

.copy-center[
Inspired by Spanish film artist and inventor **José Val del Omar’s** evocative concept of the "apanoramic overflow" of the screen (in which the image spills out onto walls, floor, even audience), the installation questions the fixed position of the viewer. In Parallax brings both the device and the body to a purely sensory cinematic experience. Letting visitors move freely around (or, in VR, penetrate) the screen while feeling sound intimately and collectively, the installation is a playful inquiry into how we see objects and experience the world from different perspectives

# Intra Protocol

.copy-center[
_Intra Protocol_ is an installation-performance which occupies and enlivens the audiovisual systems of the cinema. In conversation with the broader context of expanded cinema, the piece sets out to interrogate the technical apparatus of a contemporary digital cinema environment. Manipulating the elements of projection, speaker arrays, and lighting rigs as a form of experimental audiovisual composition. We consider this to be a practise of ‘social architecture’, thinking about the cinema as a constructed environment that shapes and conditions our behaviours and responses. This peice moves between traditional cinematic space and the ‘microcinema’ of personal devices. The composition is a communication protocol, or a script, for a new cinematic interface..

# Intra Protocol

.copy-center[
From club-like sound system bass tones and beats, to the monument of the screen glowing with LED sound sensitive lights, to frenzied colour fields and a distributed synthesizer on the audience’s own mobile phone devices – Intra Protocol plays with anticipation in an unexpected ‘happening’ to use the theatre itself as a creative tool.

Conceived to accompany the **Australian Centre for the Moving Image’s** exhibition **Light: Works from Tate’s Collection**, and programmed by **Liquid Architecture** in responses to **Lis Rhodes’** influential film installation, Light Music (1975), for a live performance and screening event.

<br />

Intra Protocol was created and realised by Matt Spendlove & Sally Golding.

# Decompression

> Decompression unravels in the spirit of a 'happening' – an encounter between audiences, space and the elements of cinematic abstraction, explored via the artists' longstanding interest in expanded cinema and sound system culture.

# Transduction

> Transduction is a spatial's performative, live-coded, opti-sonic intervention designed for projection and multi-channel sound. Presented as an abstract animation of visual music, illusory visual and psychoacoustic effects probe perception via experimental psychological processes and kinetic optical techniques.

# Assembly Now [online]

> Assembly Now [online] is a virtual experience of the artists’ recent installation, which inaugurated Metro Arts’ new main gallery as part of Brisbane Festival 2020. Simulating and expanding on the physical installation, participants are immersed in a work that plays with perception, interactivity and unexpected encounters – including the viewer’s own image captured, integrated and combined with other viewers within the artwork.

# Your Double My Double Our Ghost - South London Gallery

> Your Double My Double Our Ghost shown at South London Gallery, is a participatory installation which explores interaction and perception within a multi-sensory environment involving generative coding, lighting and projection onto optical sheeting, sonic composition, and the viewer’s own reflection. The installation acts as a space for the consideration of intimacy and meditation through the merging of the gallery visitor’s reflections which construct a new composition of light and sound in an otherwise dark chamber.
