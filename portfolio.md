# In Parallax

.copy-center[
What is a cinema without images? What are the sensorial conditions of vision? _In Parallax_ expands the traditional architectural space of film by doubling the in-real-life (IRL) gallery screen via a complementary virtual reality (VR) experience. The resulting parallax centralises the viewer in the space between IRL and VR, suspending them amidst two possible viewings of an interconnected but differently realised work.

# In Parallax

.copy-center[
Inspired by Spanish film artist and inventor **José Val del Omar’s** evocative concept of the "apanoramic overflow" of the screen (in which the image spills out onto walls, floor, even audience), the installation questions the fixed position of the viewer. _In Parallax_ brings both the device and the body to a purely sensory cinematic experience. Letting visitors move freely around (or, in VR, penetrate) the screen while feeling sound intimately and collectively, the installation is a playful inquiry into how we see objects and experience the world from different perspectives.

Commissioned by the **Museum of the Moving Image**, New York City, for _‘Cinema of Sensations: The Never-Ending Screen of Val del Omar’_ 10 March - 1 October 2023.

Produced and presented with the generous support of the **Australia Council for the Arts, ArtsACT**, and the **Australian Consulate-General**, New York.

name: intra-protocol

# Intra Protocol

.copy-center[
_Intra Protocol_ is an installation-performance which occupies and enlivens the audiovisual systems of the cinema. In conversation with the broader context of expanded cinema, the piece sets out to interrogate the technical apparatus of a contemporary digital cinema environment. Manipulating the elements of projection, speaker arrays, and lighting rigs as a form of experimental audiovisual composition. We consider this to be a practise of ‘social architecture’, thinking about the cinema as a constructed environment that shapes and conditions our behaviours and responses. This piece moves between traditional cinematic space and the 'microcinema' of personal devices. The composition is a communication protocol, or a script, for a new cinematic interface.

# Intra Protocol

.copy-center[
From club-like sound system bass tones and beats, to the monument of the screen glowing with LED sound sensitive lights, to frenzied colour fields and a distributed synthesizer on the audience’s own mobile phone devices – _Intra Protocol_ plays with anticipation in an unexpected ‘happening’ to use the theatre itself as a creative tool.

Conceived to accompany the **Australian Centre for the Moving Image’s** exhibition **Light: Works from Tate’s Collection**, and programmed by **Liquid Architecture** in response to **Lis Rhodes'** influential film installation, _Light Music_ (1975), for a live performance and screening event.

<br />

_Intra Protocol_ was created and realised by Matt Spendlove & Sally Golding.

# Decompression

.copy-center[
_Decompression_ unravels in the spirit of a 'happening' – an encounter between audiences, space and the elements of cinematic abstraction, explored via the artists' longstanding interest in expanded cinema and sound system culture.

.footnote[https://mattspendlove.com/articles/5-decompression]

# Decompression

.copy-center[
_Decompression_ brings scope to the examination of cinematic conditions by introducing live coding resulting in electronic sound and LED light compositions, and improvised direct to camera manipulations of frame rate interference, eliciting stroboscopic and sonic states. Threaded throughout the performance is an examination of the original text **_Expanded Cinema_ by Gene Youngblood** (1970), which re-purposed, poses questions concerning contemporary technological-utopia, pressing the issue of the viewing experience and mass entertainment into relevance with regards to today’s globally connected audiences. The performance also features a ‘prepared’ light sensitive screen, tactile projection beams, and surround sound.

# Decompression

.copy-center[
_Decompression_ considers the point at which contemporary expanded cinema meets algorithmic event. An ongoing point of enquiry, the live audiovisual composition seeks to highlight: the ‘dematerialisation’ of technology via spatial activation of the sound system, programmed LED lighting and manipulated projection beams; ‘deterritorialization’ touching on the audience’s potential role as participant; and ‘detemporalization’ in which the concept of time-based media is instead driven by generative software processes.

>You’d be hard-pressed to call what we saw a film, but it was most certainly an experience. If you could imagine a hypnotic cross between a club, a light show, and a cinema you’d be mostly right.

_Hey Art, What's Good?_, Oct 2018

# Transduction

.copy-center[
_Transduction_ is a performative, opti-sonic intervention designed for projection and multi-channel sound. Presented as an abstract animation of visual music, illusory visual and psychoacoustic effects probe perception via experimental psychological processes and kinetic optical techniques.

The performance is algorithmically generated and manipulated in realtime via live coding.

# Assembly Now [online]

.copy-center[
_Assembly Now [online]_ uses the interface of the mirror via the participant’s own computer screens to elaborate the psychology and technology of emergent algorithmic software, which functions as a contemporary screen filtering our emotions. Simulating and expanding the physical installation, participants in the online version are immersed in a work that plays with perception, interactivity and unexpected encounters – including the viewer’s own reflection captured and integrated within the artwork.

.copy-center[
>Instead of seeing his own image reflected, his vision appeared to him to extend indefinitely… I could perceive quite plainly what appeared to be a ray of light emitted from my epigastrium, which illuminated objects in the room.

<br />

# Your Double My Double Our Ghost

.copy-center[
_Your Double My Double Our Ghost_ shown at **South London Gallery**, takes representation and the Double as a starting point by considering a psychical excursion of heautoscopy and autoscopy - two known conditions in psychiatry and neurology, the first in which one has a feeling of seeing one’s own body at a distance, and the second in which an individual perceives the surrounding environment from a different perspective.

# Your Double My Double Our Ghost

.copy-center[
In designing a composition for light and sound, we introduced a flexible silver two-way mirror as the centrepiece of the room, inviting viewers to interact with it much in the same way as with a funfair mirror. In playing with heautoscopy, the viewer may not see their own reflection when looking in the mirror, or their image may only be seen by others, or perhaps when doubled with another viewer they may consider themselves as an Other. By opening up a contemplative space or hallucinatory fantasy, the work has characteristics based around imaginary perceptions and perceptual distortions of the Self.

Across controlled phasing of projector and LED lights articulated through custom software and custom built light sensitive instruments, the performances expanded the space of the gallery, cinema and club, overflowing to encompass the audience.

Aural and optic feedback systems, prepared screens, and shadow play, invite the audience to experience dynamic flow states and unexpected encounters.

# Breaching Transmissions

.copy-center[
Immersive audiovisual performance with Sally Golding, taking the audience on a hallucinogenic dark carnival ride exploring the slippage between parapsychology and technology.

Exploring themes of 'transmission' and 'medium', _Breaching Transmissions_ implicates the audience as participant by harnessing abstract infrared camera images of the viewer’s bodies in space to reconfigure the typical performer-technology-audience relationship. A sensory assault probing the 'haunted' in modern media, inhabiting the space between illusion and perception to manifest spectral horror and the etheric double.
